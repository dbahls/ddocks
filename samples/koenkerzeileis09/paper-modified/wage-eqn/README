This directory contains the data for the paper:  Asymptotic Theory
and Econometric Practice

The raw data is in the file data.raw and the file edd edits this to produce
the file data. In the latter there are 6 columns

	1	id number of paper
	2	number of eqs in paper
	3	year of publication -1969
	4	subject (see file subj and edd for coding)
	5	dimension of model
	6	sample size


Note added August, 2007

Amazingly this seems to still work, that is edd does produce a data file that
is consistent with the original project.  I've added a row of labels to this
file.  The file wage.R estimates the first simple poisson model of the paper.
Note the use of 1/m weights.
